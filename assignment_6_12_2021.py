# 1. create a list and find the average of that list using numpy

import numpy as np

num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
avg = np.mean(num_list)
print(avg)

# 2. create a nested dictionary
def nested_dict():
    nested_dict = {'key1': {'key2': {'key3': 'value'}}}
    print(nested_dict)

nested_dict()

# 3. create a list and find the median value
num_list_2 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]
median = np.median(num_list_2)
print(median)

# 4. what is the output of the following code?
# l = [None] * 10
# print(len(l))
10

# 5. Briefly explain Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort and selection sort algorithms.
# Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
# Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.
# Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts the items by selecting the next item each time and putting it in the correct position.

# 6. What is the output of the following code?
# aList = [5, 10, 15, 25]
# print(aList[::-2])
[25, 10]

# 7. What is the output of the following code?
my_list = ["Hello", "Python"]
print("-".join(my_list))
# Hello-Python

# 8. A python tuple can also be created using paranthesis(True or False)
# True

# 9. What is the output of the following code?
# aTuple = "Yellow", 20 , "Red"
# a,b,c = aTuple
# print(a)

# Yellow

# 10. Please select the answer in the code to empty the following dictionary
# student = {
#     "name": "Emma",
#     "class": 9,
#     "marks": 75
# }

# student.clear()
